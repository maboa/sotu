				<div class="year-analysis">

					<h1 style="font-size:80px;color:#1f77b4;line-height:0px">2009</h1>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#1f77b4;">"We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before."</span>

					<p>As is the case following any president's first inauguration, Barack Obama did not technically deliver a State of the Union address in 2009 but an address to a joint session of Congress - to outline his economic platform during a time of major financial crisis.</p>

					<p>The political climate was very different just four years ago. Nancy Pelosi sat above Obama as Speaker of the House and Obama is seen buoyed by the enthusiasm of a historic election. However, the economic situation he had inherited was grim, and the aim of his speech was to lay the groundwork for a recovery plan.</p>

					<p>In 2009, President Obama used the words “budget” and “plan” far more than in subsequent years, during which neither was in the top 100 terms used.</p>

					<h2 style="color:#1f77b4;">Key themes</h2>

					<p>The speech introduced the main idea of economic hardship and then delved into responsibility for the crisis. Obama's list of reasons for the US economic decline included energy dependence, disproportionate healthcare costs, the lack of educational competitiveness and debt - both national and personal.</p>

					<p>The president blamed a collective failure of judgement, saying both government and individuals are to blame for the financial situation.</p>

					<p>Obama then cited a new foundation for lasting prosperity: job creation, deficit reduction, tax decreases, as well as investments in healthcare, energy and education.</p>

					<p>He explained the fundamentals of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, along with a tax cut for 95 percent of the American people, a college tax credit, and increased unemployment benefits.</p>

					<p>The next segment focused on the recovery of the financial system. Among the initiatives mentioned is a new lending fund for cars, college tuition and small businesses. There was also a housing plan to refinance mortgages and an effort to ensure major banks will begin lending again, as well as hold problematic institutions accountable.</p>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#1f77b4;">"In a time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politics of the moment."</span>

					<p>The speech then covered new financial regulation and Obama's proposal for the budget and ideas about using government as a catalyst for private enterprise.</p>

					<p>Obama said competition would define the clean energy market and that Chinese efforts trumped US accomplishments in that field. He mentioned innovations with solar technology and plug-in hybrids.</p>

					<p>The president outlined an ambitious energy platform, with the aim of doubling the nation’s supply of renewable energy in just three years. And he promised to allocate $15bn a year to develop clean energy technology.</p>

					<p>Obama’s signature policy issue from his first term was discussed, and the president emphasised that health care reform was an immediate priority for Congress.</p>

					<p>For education, Obama’s proposal was to prevent budget cuts for schools while making college more affordable to students around the country. By 2020, he said America would once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.</p>

					<p>In an effort to diminish America’s deficit (then $1.4tn), Obama claimed he would cut that number in half by the end of his first term by ending wasteful spending, eliminating no-bid contracts, reforming the defence budget, rooting out Medicare fraud and ending the Bush tax cuts.</p>

					<p>Obama then laid out a vision for the US role in the international system.</p>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#1f77b4;">“In words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun, for we know that America cannot meet the threats of this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without America.”</span>

					<p>He pledged to end the war in Iraq and to end the practice of torture. He said he would close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and promote increased co-operation within the international system - to alleviate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, diminish nuclear proliferation and enhance financial stability.</p>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#1f77b4;">“As we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us, watching to see what we do with this moment, waiting for us to lead.”</span>

					<p>Obama closed his speech with an appeal to bipartisanship</p>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#1f77b4;">“I know that we haven't agreed on every issue thus far. There are surely times in the future where we will part ways. But I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed.”</span>

				<div id="analysis-10" class="year-analysis">

					<h1 style="font-size:80px;color:#ff7f0e;line-height:0px">2010</h1>


					<span class="quote" style="color:#ff7f0e;">Again, we are tested.  And again, we must answer history's call.”</span>

					<p>Technically delivering his first State of the Union address, President Obama gave the 2010 State of the Union with his first year accomplishments and shortcomings in mind.</p>

					<p>The reality of governance had set in on the president and the address took on the form of a defence of his policies, a restatement of his core political ideals and an emphatic plea for unity within Congress over its future legislative agenda.</p>

					<p>Judging by a sentiment analysis, his 2010 speech was less emotively neutral than any of the other addresses of Obama’s first term. There was a higher percentage of words that were either strongly positive or strongly negative. In addition, there were also more words that reflected significant anger or sadness.</p>

					<h2 style="color:#ff7f0e;">Key Themes</h2>

					<p>Obama began his speech with a dissection of the the vast number of challenges that he had inherited, as well those which had come about in the first year of his presidency.</p>

					<p>Extolling the resilience of the American people, Obama called on Congress to work with a sense of urgency.</p>

					<p>The president began his speech focused on the economy by describing the actions he had taken in his first year towards resolving America’s financial crisis. He touted the Recovery Act, commonly known as the stimulus bill, unpopular but “necessary” bank bailout, as well as tax cuts. He said unemployment benefit increases and extensions saved two million American jobs.</p>

					<p>The focus of this section was job-creation, for which Obama proposed a jobs bill that would use a variety of tax incentives as well as funding for infrastructure and energy projects to promote job growth.</p>

					<p>The president then began outlining the large-scale challenges that he argued were hampering America’s potential for growth and decreasing its global competitiveness.</p>

					<p>Obama highlighted financial regulation, energy innovation incentives, an increase in US exports and educational investment as the four keys to future growth. On each he asked that both parties contribute to enacting new policies.</p>

					<p>Acknowledging the divisive nature of healthcare reform for “nearly a century”, Obama launched a full-forced defence of its necessity.</p>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#ff7f0e;">“Here's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform. Not now. Not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people. Let's get it done. Let's get it done.”</span>

					<p>When moving on to the deficit, Obama was quick to demonstrate that the stark fiscal situation was inherited from the previous administration. He defended the addition of a trillion dollars to the national debt as “the right thing to do” given the economic crisis the US was mired in. He then offered a spending freeze to combat the growing national debt and proposed additional taxes for wealthy individuals and companies.</p>

					<p>In an unconventional presidential remark, Obama critiqued the Supreme Court’s “Citizen’s United” decision overturning the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and urged Congress to correct the problems the decision would supposedly incur.</p>

					<p>Addressing both parties in the chamber, Obama then called on legislators to build trust. He personally promised to engage the leadership of both sides on a regular basis.</p>

					<p>The president proceeded to discuss matters of foreign policy, providing concrete timelines for the withdrawal of troops from both the Iraqi and Afghan theatres.</p>

					<p>He then spoke about nuclear proliferation, international development, financial stability and combatting certain diseases.</p>

					<p>Obama closed his speech with a rousing defence of American ideals and a plea to deliver on the promises that will establish more faith between the people and their government.</p>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#ff7f0e;">“Our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved. But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year.”</span>

				</div>





				<div class="year-analysis">

					<h1 style="font-size:80px;color:#2ca02c;line-height:0px">2011</h1>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#2ca02c;">“Win the future.”</span>


					<p>This State of the Union address given by President Barack Obama differed from his 2010 address in a significant way. John Boehner flanked him, having replaced Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House and ushering in the 112th Congress that was distinguished by its Republican majority in the House.</p>

					<p>Having won a seemingly impossible battle the previous year by passing the most significant healthcare reform since the 1960s, the president struck a chord of unity.</p>

					<p>Words having to do with “money” were used with half the frequency in 2011 (about 1 out of 50 terms) as they had been in 2009.</p>

					<h2 style="color:#2ca02c;">Key Themes</h2>

					<p>The president opened his remarks with a meditation on the Tuscon shooting which almost claimed the life of Rep Gabrielle Giffords and called on members of both parties to legislate with a sense of shared purpose.</p>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#2ca02c;">“Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater - something more consequential than party or political preference.”</span>


					<p>The first area of policy discussion was the economy. Obama touted decent growth and stock market figures, but cautioned against ignoring additional challenges.</p>

					<p>Citing technological shifts and the effects of globalisation, Obama said, “The rules have changed” and that the US could not be complacent about its position in the world. He argued these global economic changes could serve as a catalyst for encouraging greater American innovation, introducing the speech’s main theme of “winning the future”.</p>

					<p>The first policy prescription was large-scale government investment in research, financed in part by eliminating subsidies to oil companies.</p>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#2ca02c;">“So instead of subsidizing yesterday’s energy, let’s invest in tomorrow’s.”</span>


					<p>Two other critical policies to “win the future” were clean energy investments and educational competitiveness. He touted his Race to the Top initiative to create meaningful school reforms and then emphasised that educational success was most significantly affected by teachers and parents at a local level.</p>

					<p>Bridging his discussion of education to the issue of immigration, Obama called for a comprehensive package dealing with illegal immigrants and border security.</p>

					<p>An important component of Obama’s “Winning the Future” platform was to modernise and enhance America’s physical and technological infrastructure to increase competitiveness, facilitate business and encourage greater investment.</p>

					<p>Related to the topic of international competitiveness, Obama singled out the complex and unfair tax code and the need for Congress to pass trade agreements.</p>

					<p>Obama defended the healthcare reforms passed earlier in the year and asked the audience not to let that legislation divide them.</p>

					<p>Proposing a five-year spending freeze, Obama committed himself to new spending cuts, but only those that would not be “on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens”.</p>

					<p>However, he said bringing the deficit down would require measures that decrease entitlement spending and reform the tax code.</p>

					<p>Obama then touched on the matter of governmental efficiency and structure, discussing how to increase transparency.</p>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#2ca02c;">“The 21st century government that’s open and competent. A government that lives within its means. An economy that’s driven by new skills and new ideas.”</span>


					<p>Extolling the strides made in Iraq and Afghanistan, Obama nevertheless warned against the threat of al-Qaeda.</p>

					<p>Obama talked about nuclear proliferation, described the importance of maintaining good relations across the Americas and then praised the troops.</p>

					<p>The president closed his address by reflecting on the ideals upon which the country was founded and touted equality of opportunity as one of America’s most prized virtues.</p>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#2ca02c;">“From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream. That’s how we win the future.”</span>

				<div class="year-analysis">

					<h1 style="font-size:80px;color:#d62728;line-height:0px">2012</h1>
					<span class="quote" style="color:#d62728;">“For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country.”</span>

					<p>The speech opened by addressing the end of America’s nine-year presence in Iraq.</p>

					<p>Obama said it was the first time in nine years there were no Americans fighting in Iraq, that Osama bin Laden was no longer a threat to America, and that the majority of al-Qaeda’s top lieutenants had been defeated.</p>

					<p>Appearing once in every 15 terms, words relating to “work” were used more in 2012 than during any of the other State of the Union addresses from his first term.</p>

					<h2 style="color:#d62728;">Key Themes</h2>

					<p>In the 2012 speech, Obama blamed both banks and regulators for contributing to the economic crisis and profiting from mortgages that people could not afford.</p>

					<p>He then said nearly 3.2 million jobs were created in the prior 22 months and that in 2011 the most jobs had been created since 2005. Then Obama added that Wall Street would be held accountable in the future.</p>

					<p>The president said American manufacturing was integral to a robust economy, as the auto industry was recovering. Obama declared how General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford had again become leading automakers.</p>

					<p>He then focused on the tax code, stating that companies moving their business overseas should not get tax breaks. Obama also suggested that multinational companies should have to pay a basic minimum tax, and that American manufacturers should get larger tax cuts.</p>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#d62728;">“It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America.”</span>

					<p>The speech then focused on American exports, and Obama said his goal of doubling American exports over five years was ahead of schedule.</p>

					<p>Obama then announced the creation of Trade Enforcement Unit that would investigate unfair trading practices. New inspections aimed to prevent counterfeit and unsafe goods from entering the US.</p>

					<p>He stressed that more Americans would be trained, starting with of a national commitment to train two million Americans with skills that lead to jobs.</p>

					<p>Obama discussed the education system, proposing that all students stay in high school till graduating or the age of 18. He suggested stopping interest rates on student loans from doubling, extending tuition tax credits and increasing work-study jobs.</p>

					<span class="quote" style="color:#d62728;">“Higher education can’t be a luxury - it is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.”</span>

					<p>Illegal immigration was briefly addressed and Obama said comprehensive reform must happen.</p>

					<p>He explained the importance of removing regulations that prevent entrepreneurs from getting financing, and expanding tax relief to small businesses.</p>

					<p>Obama directed his administration to open 75 percent of the potential offshore oil and gas resources.</p>

					<p>The speech then moved to developing clean energy that would help manufacturers eliminate energy waste.</p>

					<p>He then said big banks and financial institutions would be required to write out a “living will”.</p>

					<p>The Financial Crimes Unit was proposed as a solution to large-scale fraud and a protection for people’s investments. He then proposed a special unit to investigate the lending and packaging of mortgages that led to the housing crisis.</p>

					<p>He suggests a tax code change where people making more than $250,000 would pay more in taxes than families making under $250,000.</p>

					<p>The speech then addressed the need for a bill to ban insider trading by members of Congress, and limit elected officials from owning stocks in industries they impact.</p>

					<p>Obama covered changes that should be made in Congress, the executive branch and the Senate. Obama requested the authority to “consolidate the federal bureaucracy”.</p>

					<p>He then addressed the war in Afghanistan that is winding down. Obama said 10,000 troops had already come home and 23,000 more were expected to return by the end of summer 2012.</p>

					<p>Obama said he would ensure that America would stand up against violence and intimidation and advocate for the rights and dignity of people everywhere. He then proposed a new defence strategy that would save nearly $500bn in the US budget.</p>

					<p>The president proposed the Veteran Jobs Corps to help enlist veterans in the workforce and said companies that hire vets will be provided with new tax credits.</p>

					<p>The speech ended by reflecting on the mission that led to the capture of Osama bin Laden.</p>
